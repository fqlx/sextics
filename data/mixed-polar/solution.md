# Mixed polar: balanced first variation and a Jacobian primitive

This construction is a nonconstructive proof of the certificate existence
statement for the fixed `mixed-polar` instance, with $q=1$ and
$A=X_0X_1X_2Y_0Y_1Y_2$. It uses a finite algebraic extension, polynomial
integration, normalized trace, and homogeneous clearing. It does not output
explicit denominator or numerator polynomials.

Prepared for `benediamond` with OpenAI Codex assistance. The proof uses the
maintained `TransitiveCubic`, `PolynomialCurves`, `ResidueTransport`, and
`HoldoutCover` libraries. Their attribution to `fqlx`,
`hodgepodgeconjecture`, `HeadOfNaps`, and the Lean/mathlib contributors is
retained. The accepted mixed-biweight and cycle-three constructions supply
the polynomial-family and residue-transport architecture. The new inputs
are the reverse-edge shear, the balanced first variation, the exact
mixed-polar Jacobian model and incidence seed, and their physical binding.
Earlier bounded denominator calculations by `1337isnot1337` in the
[instance discussion](https://github.com/hodge-computer/sextics/discussions/58)
are compatible with this unrestricted existence argument.

## The exact cubic quotient

Work in the function field of the immutable sextic. On the indicated open
chart put

$$
v=Y_0/X_0,\quad c_1=(Y_1/X_1)/v,\quad c_2=(Y_2/X_2)/v,
\quad R=X_2^2,\quad x=X_0^2/R,\quad y=X_1^2/R.
$$

All physical coordinate denominators are nonzero in this field. Direct
substitution gives $F=R^3U$ and $A=c_1c_2v^3R^3xy$, where

$$
U=ax^3+by^3+cz^3+dx^2y+ey^2z+fxy^2,\qquad z=1,
$$

$$
(a,b,c,d,e,f)=
(1+v^6,1+c_1^6v^6,1+c_2^6v^6,c_1v^2/2,c_1c_2v^2/2,c_1^3v^4/3).
$$

Adjoin a root $k$ of $3ak^2+2dk+f=0$. Both $a$ and
$d^2-3af$ are proved nonzero on the exact physical field. The determinant-one
substitution $x=X+ky$ changes the cubic to

$$
aX^3+b'y^3+cz^3+d'X^2y+ey^2z,
\quad b'=b+ak^3+dk^2+fk,\quad d'=d+3ak,
$$

with $(d')^2=d^2-3af\ne0$. This is precisely the maintained transitive
cubic family, with its sixth coefficient zero.

## Covariants and the actual source

Use the maintained integral covariants $H,\Theta,J$, normalized so that

$$
\xi=\Theta/H^2,\quad \eta=-J/(2H^3),\qquad
\eta^2=\xi^3+s_4\xi-s_6/4,\qquad
U_xD_y\xi=6\eta.
$$

The normalization follows the classical constructions of
[Tom Fisher](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~taf1000/papers/g1hessians.pdf)
and [SageMath invariant theory](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/polynomial_rings/sage/rings/invariants/invariant_theory.html),
as recorded in the shared library. Nonvanishing after the quadratic shear
is proved by a resultant in an explicit localization. At the exact point
$(2,2i,1-i,1+i,0,0)$, the shear equation specializes to $3ak^2$ and
both diagonal covariants are nonzero. This proves nonvanishing for either
chosen root without evaluating arbitrary rational functions at that point.

The balanced source corresponds to the first variation $xyz$. After the
base shear it is $(X+ky)yz$. An infinitesimal determinant-one shear
$X\mapsto X-\lambda z/(2d')$ changes this to the coefficient variation

$$
\dot e=k,\qquad \dot f_{\mathrm{transitive}}=-3a/(2d').
$$

Its source is $(X+ky)y-U_X/(2d')$, which leaves the complete
second-normal expression unchanged. Dual numbers implement this variation
before specialization; no auxiliary parameter derivation is assumed on the
fixed field. The invariant derivatives descend to

$$
\dot s_4=(9abc-cdf)/2,\qquad \dot s_6=-4acde^2.
$$

Writing $g=U_x$, $g_\lambda=y-xyU_{xx}/g$, and
$\dot b=-\dot s_6/4$, the resulting moving-map identity is

$$
\frac{g_\lambda}{g}=
\frac{\dot s_4\xi+\dot b}{2\eta^2}
-\frac g3 D_y\left(\frac{\dot\xi}{2\eta}\right).
$$

The physical $X_0$-normal is also retained. With
$S=X_0F_{X_0}+Y_0F_{Y_0}$, the correction has sole nonzero tangent component
$-AY_0/S$ in the $Y_0$ slot. The complete physical normal source equals
$c_1c_2v^3g_\lambda/g$ plus the residue divergence of this correction.

## A polynomial source on the Jacobian

Set $T=Rv^6$, $X_J=R^2\xi$, $Y_J=R^3\eta$. Then

$$
E=Y_J^2-X_J^3-A_4X_J-B_6=0,
$$

where $A_4=R^4s_4$ and $B_6=-R^6s_6/4$ are polynomials of
degrees four and six in $(R,T)$. `JacobianModel.lean` gives the integral
equation $432E$. For $A_0=R+T$, $B_0=R+c_1^6T$, $C_0=R+c_2^6T$, the
polynomial numerator to integrate is

$$
P_J=\frac{c_1c_2C_0}{3456}
\left[(108A_0B_0-2c_1^4RT)X_J
+3c_1^3c_2^2R^2A_0T\right].
$$

Its exact pullback is
$c_1c_2R^5(\dot s_4\xi+\dot b)/144$.

For polynomial curves on $432E$, use $T=s$ and degrees $(2,4,6)$ for
$(R,X_J,Y_J)$, fixing the constant terms of $R,X_J$. The thirteen coefficient
equations in thirteen remaining coefficients have the following exact
solution modulo five at $(c_1,c_2,R(0),X_J(0))=(1,3,1,4)$:

$$
R=1+4s+4s^2,\quad
X_J=4+3s+2s^2+2s^3+4s^4,\quad
Y_J=1+s^2+s^4+s^6.
$$

The full incidence Jacobian is invertible; its explicit inverse and its
binding to the actual polynomial partial derivatives are kernel checked.
The shared arithmetic lifting theorem therefore supplies a generic
polynomial family over a finite coefficient extension. Independent endpoint
parameters prove dominance and finiteness over the Jacobian function field.
A polynomial normal with pairing one has nonzero normal/tangent
determinant. The shared polynomial-family residue bridge and normalized
finite trace give a rational residue primitive for every polynomial
numerator, in particular $P_J$.

## Pullback, descent, and clearing

The physical-to-Jacobian coordinate determinant is checked directly,
including derivatives of the chosen algebraic shear in passive directions.
For the distinguished normal derivatives its density multiplier is

$$
\frac{F_{X_0}\det M}{2Y_J}=-144Rv^3.
$$

Piola pullback transports the Jacobian primitive. Adding the moving-map
correction and subtracting the normal-chart correction produces the exact
physical residue-divergence solution in the finite quadratic extension.
Normalized trace descends it to the original physical function field.

Finally, the exact sextic is irreducible: the maintained specialization
reduces its monic presentation to
$X^6+((T+1)^6-1)$, and Eisenstein applies. Shared residue clearing therefore
gives a denominator coprime to $F$. Shared homogeneous clearing uses the
proved degrees $\deg F=\deg A=6$ to produce the required homogeneous
$D,N_i,Q$. The quotient $Q$ is unrestricted. `TargetBinding.lean` binds
these physical polynomials to the immutable target, and `Solution.lean`
exports the protected theorem `Submission.certificate`.
